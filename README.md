# NixOS Config
Install on a brand new system by running: 
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/kativenOG/nix-conf
cd nix-conf
./install.sh
```
NB: if its the first time you are using this config on the laptop move the /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix file in the nix-conf/nixos/hardware directory.
